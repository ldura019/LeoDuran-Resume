        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 18 years old and come from a city called Pomona. I went to Garey High school for 4 years where I always wanted to apply to UCR. I am the first generation in the family to go to college. I wanted to attend college because I believe education is the way to success. There are people that don’t need college but I feel like college can really help me to educate myself and learn new things until I get to choose my career. I always wanted to apply for computer engineering because I thought that would be my career and that it was not going to be that hard. I really liked my class in high school that was computer science but it is nothing compared to the coding I was going to do in college. College is more competitive but computers was something that actually interested me compared to other things. I never really had a thought or idea about what major I was going to choose but computer engineering was definitely one of those that I was kind of interested in. 
<br><br>

       I am in my first year of college and it has gone pretty good so far. I feel like the first quarter was going to be a little stressful because I was going to have to adapt to many things. I had to adapt to the food, dorm, classes and homework assignments. I also had to get comfortable with my roommates and talk with them as really close friends since I was going to live with them the whole year. Throughout my first quarter I had a lot of units which means a lot of classes. I had math, english, psychology, and chicano studies which was a lot to take. I tried managing my time in order to get good grades but it was really hard at first. I then started getting used to it and little by little started getting my things together. The homework wasn’t as hard anymore and it made me feel good about myself because I wasn’t feeling stressed as in the first couple of weeks of class.
 <br><br>

        I then had midterms and finals for the first quarter and it was getting harder for the last week of class. I ended up passing all my classes so that was good. We then went on winter break. Then came back after a good three weeks and the second quarter started for us which was winter quarter. I am currently still in winter quarter. My classes have been pretty good because I only have three this quarter but they are really spread out and not back to back classes. I am doing good in all my classes but I do feel like the one that is kicking my ass right now is comparative politics. I think it is because I am not really a big fan about talking about politics and the government and all that. Every other class has been a success and I can’t wait to finish strong this year.
